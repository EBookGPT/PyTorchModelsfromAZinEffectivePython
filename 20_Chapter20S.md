# Chapter 20: Sentiment Analysis 

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we learned all about text classification- a technique that enables us to classify the text into various categories like spam and ham. We hope you enjoyed that chapter and have a basic understanding of text classification techniques now. 

In this chapter, we will talk about Sentiment Analysis - a natural language processing task of classifying text based on the emotional tone of the language. Sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications, such as in customer feedback analysis, stock price prediction, movie reviews, and many more. 

To unravel the depths of Sentiment Analysis, we are thrilled to introduce our special guest, Yann LeCun. Yann LeCun is a pioneer in the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and was awarded the Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science, in 2018 for his work on deep learning. His expertise on this topic is unparalleled, and we are honored to have him join us. 

Before we get into the core of sentiment analysis, we must familiarize ourselves with the basics of deep learning and PyTorch. 

Are you ready, dear reader? Let's dive into Sentiment Analysis with the guidance of our esteemed guest and the power of PyTorch!
# Chapter 20: Sentiment Analysis

It was a dark and stormy night in London when Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson received a distressing call from their friend at the Scotland Yard. 

"A prominent movie critic has been missing, and his last review article suggested that he was in danger. The review was based on a new movie about a crime scene that is investigated using the latest deep learning techniques. We need your help in finding the critic and apprehending the perpetrator. Can you help us, Mr. Holmes?" asked Inspector Lestrade.

Sherlock Holmes, with his keen sense of observation, deduced that the critic was indeed in danger, and the movie review contained hidden clues. Once they reached the last known location of the critic, they found a written note that read: "My first name is Positive, and my last name is Negative. Find me or else!"

With his expertise in sentiment analysis, Yann LeCun immediately recognized that the first and last name were, in fact, opposite in sentiment polarity. Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson understood the significance of the message and started looking for the movie critic. They found another clue that read: "I am hidden in plain sight. Can you decode my location?"

With the help of the latest sentiment analysis PyTorch model that they developed, Yann was able to uncover a hidden message in the article. The message contained coordinates that pointed towards an abandoned building in the outskirts of London. 

When Holmes and Watson reached the location, they found the movie critic tied up in a corner. The perpetrator, it turned out, was the movie director himself, who wanted to create hype around his movie using these twisted means. 

Thanks to the power of sentiment analysis and the quick deduction skills of Sherlock Holmes, the missing critic was found, and the culprit was apprehended. 

Dear reader, sentiment analysis has a vast range of applications, and as we have seen in this exciting mystery, is essential in solving real-life problems. With the power of PyTorch models and Yann LeCun's guidance, we can harness the strength of this technique to unveil hidden emotions in just about any text.
Certainly, dear reader. Let us discuss the PyTorch code used to solve the mystery:

First, we load and prepare the data for our sentiment analysis PyTorch model using the IMDb dataset, which contains reviews labeled as positive or negative:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchtext.datasets import IMDB
from torchtext.data import Field, BucketIterator

torch.manual_seed(42)

TEXT = Field(tokenize = 'spacy')
LABEL = Field(dtype = torch.float)

train_data, test_data = IMDB.splits(TEXT, LABEL)

TEXT.build_vocab(train_data, max_size = 25000, vectors = "glove.6B.100d")
LABEL.build_vocab(train_data)

train_iterator, test_iterator = BucketIterator.splits(
    (train_data, test_data), batch_size = 64)
```

Next, we define our sentiment analysis PyTorch model using an LSTM neural network:

```python
class SentimentAnalysis(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim, n_layers, 
                 bidirectional, dropout):
        
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, 
                            hidden_dim, 
                            num_layers=n_layers, 
                            bidirectional=bidirectional, 
                            dropout=dropout, 
                            batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2, output_dim)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
    def forward(self, text, text_lengths):
        embedded = self.dropout(self.embedding(text))
        packed_embedded = nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(embedded, text_lengths.cpu(), batch_first=True)
        packed_output, (hidden, cell) = self.lstm(packed_embedded)
        hidden = self.dropout(torch.cat((hidden[-2,:,:], hidden[-1,:,:]), dim=1))
        return self.fc(hidden)
```

We train the model and evaluate its performance:

```python
def train(model, iterator, optimizer, criterion):
    epoch_loss = 0
    epoch_acc = 0
    
    model.train()
    
    for batch in iterator:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        text, text_lengths = batch.text
        predictions = model(text, text_lengths).squeeze(1)
        loss = criterion(predictions, batch.label)
        acc = binary_accuracy(predictions, batch.label)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        epoch_loss += loss.item()
        epoch_acc += acc.item()
        
    return epoch_loss / len(iterator), epoch_acc / len(iterator)

def evaluate(model, iterator, criterion):
    epoch_loss = 0
    epoch_acc = 0
    
    model.eval()
    
    with torch.no_grad():
    
        for batch in iterator:
            text, text_lengths = batch.text
            predictions = model(text, text_lengths).squeeze(1)
            loss = criterion(predictions, batch.label)
            acc = binary_accuracy(predictions, batch.label)

            epoch_loss += loss.item()
            epoch_acc += acc.item()
        
    return epoch_loss / len(iterator), epoch_acc / len(iterator)
```

Finally, we use sentiment analysis to uncover hidden messages in the text, as demonstrated in our Sherlock Holmes mystery.

We hope this explanation of the PyTorch code used to solve the mystery has been insightful, and you are ready to utilize sentiment analysis to uncover hidden insights in your own data!
