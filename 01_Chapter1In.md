# Chapter 1 Introduction to PyTorch - A Sherlock Holmes Mystery

Dear reader,

Are you ready to embark on a thrilling journey through the world of PyTorch? Join me, Sherlock Holmes, as we unravel a mystery involving tensors and automatic differentiation.

It all started when a renowned scientist, Dr. Watson, approached me with a peculiar case. He had been working on a groundbreaking research project involving deep neural networks, but his results had suddenly become inconsistent and unreliable. His team had spent countless hours troubleshooting the code, but to no avail. 

After a quick investigation, it became apparent that the issue lied in the numerical stability of the neural network's forward and backward propagation. The tensors used to store the data were overflowing or underflowing, leading to inaccurate gradients and ultimately poor model performance. 

Fortunately, PyTorch offered a solution to this problem. With its built-in support for automatic differentiation, PyTorch could automatically compute and update gradients in a stable and efficient manner. We were able to update Dr. Watson's code to use PyTorch tensors and Run it on the GPU to speed up the computations. 

After some tuning and tweaking, Dr. Watson's neural network was able to achieve state-of-the-art results on his research project, earning him worldwide fame and recognition. 

So there you have it, dear reader. PyTorch's powerful tensor manipulation capabilities and automatic differentiation put the clues together to solve Dr. Watson's peculiar case. Stay tuned for the next chapter where we'll dive deeper into PyTorch's features and unveil more mysteries.

Yours truly, 
Sherlock Holmes
Certainly, dear reader. 

To help Dr. Watson solve his instability issue, we leveraged PyTorch's powerful tensor manipulation capabilities and automatic differentiation. Here is an example of how we used PyTorch to build and train a simple neural network: 

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.flatten(x, start_dim=1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = nn.functional.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Create the optimizer and loss function
net = Net()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Train the network for one epoch
for inputs, labels in train_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = net(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

In this example, we defined a simple neural network with two fully-connected layers (fc1 and fc2). We then instantiated the network, an optimizer (stochastic gradient descent with momentum), and a loss function (cross-entropy). 

Finally, we trained the network for one epoch using PyTorch's automatic differentiation. This means that we did not need to manually compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network - PyTorch handled this computation for us using the chain rule of calculus. 

Overall, PyTorch's automatic differentiation and tensor manipulation capabilities provide a powerful toolkit for building and training neural networks. I hope this example has shed some light on how PyTorch works under the hood.
