# Chapter 14: Object Detection

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we delved into the exciting world of using pretrained models in PyTorch, and how they can be a powerful tool to leverage existing knowledge and save computational time. Now, we will explore one of the most popular topics in computer vision: object detection.

Object detection is the process of identifying objects of interest within an image and determining their locations. It is a crucial task in many real-world applications, from security systems to autonomous cars. Over the years, the field has seen significant advancements, particularly with the introduction of deep learning models.

In this chapter, we are privileged to have Ross Girshick, one of the pioneers in object detection with deep learning. Girshick is a research scientist at Facebook AI Research and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He is well known for his work on the original Faster R-CNN paper published in 2015, which provided a major breakthrough in object detection accuracy.

Girshick will help guide us through the complexities of object detection and share his insights on current best practices in the field. We will look at the two main approaches to object detection: two-stage methods, and single-stage methods. We will also explore different architectures of deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and learn about the most commonly used loss functions in object detection.

Python and PyTorch will be the main tools we use in this chapter. Specifically, we will be using the torchvision module, which provides pre-trained models and a range of datasets and utility functions for computer vision tasks.

So, let's gear up to dive into object detection, guided by the legend Ross Girshick. Stay tuned!
# King Arthur and the Quest for Object Detection

Once upon a time, in the land of Camelot, King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table were facing a daunting task. A wicked sorcerer had cast a spell, rendering everything invisible to the naked eye. The kingdom was in chaos, as nobody could find their possessions, and merchants could not sell their goods. It was a time of great trouble.

King Arthur and his knights knew that they had to act fast to break the spell. Their trusted advisor Merlin had an idea: why not use the magic of the PyTorch Models to detect the objects and bring them back into view? Arthur and his knights realized that they knew nothing about object detection, and turned to the expert on the matter, Ross Girshick.

Girshick agreed to help them in their quest, but warned that each detection model had limitations, particularly in terms of accuracy and speed. The first approach he suggested to them was the two-stage method, which involved using a region proposal network (RPN) to generate candidate object locations, which were then processed by a separate detection network to determine the object boundaries and classifications. 

The knights were intrigued, but worried about the computational complexity of the approach. Ross Girshick then suggested a single-stage method, such as the famous YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, which directly predicted object class probabilities and bounding box coordinates. This approach allowed the knights to detect objects in real-time, without the need for a separate proposal step.

After much deliberation, the knights decided to use the YOLOv5 model, which promised both high accuracy and fast inference time. They trained the model on a large dataset of images of Camelot's objects, and after some testing, they finally managed to detect everything that had previously been invisible to the naked eye. The spell was broken, and Camelot was saved!

As a token of appreciation, King Arthur invited Ross Girshick to join the knights of the Round Table, recognizing his contribution to their victory. Girshick accepted the invitation and became the first AI knight, forever changing the history of Camelot.

In conclusion, dear reader, we have learned that object detection is a powerful tool that can be used to solve complex problems, even in the magical kingdom of Camelot. With guidance from experts like Ross Girshick, and the magic of PyTorch, anything is possible. Keep exploring the world of computer vision, and stay curious!
Certainly, dear reader, let us dive into the code used to resolve King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table's quest for object detection!

As mentioned in the story, we will be using the YOLOv5 model for our object detection purposes. To train the model, we will be using the PyTorch framework and the COCO dataset, which contains over 330k images labeled with object categories and bounding box annotations.

Firstly, we need to install the PyTorch and torchvision packages, as well as the YOLOv5 package by running the following command:
```
!pip install torch torchvision torchsummary
!pip install git+https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
```

Next, we need to download the COCO dataset and split it into training and validation sets. We will be using the torchvision.datasets.CocoDetection class to handle the dataset, as follows:
```
from torchvision.datasets import CocoDetection

# set paths for COCO dataset
train_path = '/path/to/train2017'
val_path = '/path/to/val2017'
ann_path = '/path/to/annotations/instances_train2017.json'

# load dataset
train_dataset = CocoDetection(train_path, ann_path)
val_dataset = CocoDetection(val_path, ann_path)

# split dataset into smaller subset for testing
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(train_dataset, range(1000))
val_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(val_dataset, range(100))
```

We can then define our YOLOv5 model architecture, using the yolov5s configuration for faster training:
```
import torch
from torchsummary import summary
from models.experimental import attempt_load

# load the model
model = attempt_load('yolov5s', pretrained=True)

# print model summary
input_size = (3, 640, 640) # input size for YOLOv5s
summary(model, input_size=input_size)
```

Once our model is defined, we can start training it on the COCO dataset using the torch.utils.data.DataLoader class, which provides multithreaded data loading and batching capabilities:
```
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
from utils.datasets import CocoDetectionES

# set hyperparameters
batch_size = 8
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 10

# set dataloader for training and validation sets
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)

# set loss function (using Binary Cross-Entropy)
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

# set optimizer (using Adam)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# set tensorboard writer for logging training progress
writer = SummaryWriter(log_dir='/path/to/tensorboard/logs')

# train the model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # training loop
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)

        # forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        # log loss to tensorboard
        writer.add_scalar('Loss/train', loss.item(), epoch)

    # validation loop
    for images, labels in val_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)

        # forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # log loss to tensorboard
        writer.add_scalar('Loss/val', loss.item(), epoch)

    # print epoch metrics
    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Training Loss: {train_loss:.4f}, Validation Loss: {val_loss:.4f}')
```

Finally, we can use the trained model to detect objects in new images, by passing the images through the model and extracting the bounding box coordinates and class labels from the outputs:
```
from PIL import Image
from utils.general import non_max_suppression

# set model to evaluation mode
model.eval()

# define detection threshold and IOU threshold for post-processing
conf_threshold = 0.5
iou_threshold = 0.5

# load test images and pass through model
test_images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']
for image_path in test_images:
    # open image using PIL
    image = Image.open(image_path)

    # pass image through model
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(image)

    # post-process outputs (apply non-max-suppression)
    boxes = output[:, :, :4] # extract bounding box coordinates
    scores = output[:, :, 4] # extract objectness scores
    class_labels = output[:, :, 5:] # extract class probabilities
    boxes, scores, class_labels = non_max_suppression(boxes, scores, class_labels, conf_threshold, iou_threshold)

    # draw bounding boxes on image and display
    draw_boxes(image, boxes, scores, class_labels)
    image.show()
```

And there you have it, dear reader! With these code snippets, you too can become a hero in your own quest for object detection, just like King Arthur and his knights.
