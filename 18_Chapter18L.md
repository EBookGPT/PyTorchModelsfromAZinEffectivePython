# Chapter 18: Language Modeling

Welcome back, dear reader, to yet another thrilling chapter in our ongoing investigation of PyTorch Models from A-Z in Effective Python. In our last chapter, we explored the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Today, we delve deeper into this field and examine the concept of language modeling.

Language modeling is a crucial task in NLP that involves predicting the likelihood of a particular sequence of words occurring in a given language. With the help of language models, we can perform various tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text classification, to name a few.

In this chapter, we will explore different types of language models, including n-gram models and neural network-based models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models. We will learn how to train and evaluate these models using PyTorch, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and compare their performance on various benchmark datasets.

But what makes language modeling such an exciting field to explore? Apart from its practical applications, it also boasts a rich history and theoretical underpinnings. From Shannon's famous communication model to Zipf's law of word frequency, language modeling has a deep connection to information theory and linguistics. 

So, get ready to put on your detective hat as we embark on another thrilling journey of exploration, learning, and discovery in the world of PyTorch Models from A-Z in Effective Python.
# Chapter 18: Language Modeling

As always, the famous detective Sherlock Holmes was absorbed in his latest puzzling case in his Baker Street apartment. Dr. Watson arrived with news that might be of interest to Holmes. It appeared that the Crown Jewels, kept in the Tower of London, had been stolen! The thief had left a series of cryptic notes that no one could decipher. The only lead they had was the possibility that the perpetrator was a linguist. 

Knowing that Holmes had solved many such language-based puzzles, Watson sought Holmes' assistance. Holmes, deeply intrigued, decided to get straight to work.

He began by applying his extensive knowledge of language modeling to analyze the cryptic notes left by the thief. With the help of PyTorch, he began building various types of models and inputting text data to determine the likelihood of various phrases occurring. 

After trying several models, including n-gram models and RNNs, he finally found a transformer-based language model that could accurately predict the sequence of words likely to follow each other in the cryptic notes. Using this model, he was able to decipher the meaning of the cryptic notes and crack the case!

The culprit turned out to be an expert in language and linguistic analysis who had long wanted to steal the Crown Jewels. Using their knowledge, they had created the cryptic notes to confuse the police, but in the end, their expertise was no match for the power of language models.

With the case solved, Holmes turned to Watson and explained how language modeling could be applied in many different fields, including predictive text and speech recognition. Watson was fascinated and immediately began to delve further into this remarkable technology.

And so, dear reader, we conclude another chapter of our PyTorch Models from A-Z in Effective Python book. Join us next time as we delve into yet another world of exploration and discovery!
# Chapter 18: Language Modeling

In order to crack the cryptic notes left by the thief using PyTorch, Sherlock Holmes used various types of language models, ultimately landing on the transformer-based model as the most accurate choice in predicting sequences of words.

Here is an example of how he used PyTorch and the transformer-based model to predict the next word in a given sequence:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define model architecture
class TransformerModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_dim, num_heads, num_layers):
        super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoder(embed_dim, dropout=0.1, max_len=500)
        encoder_layers = torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(embed_dim, num_heads)
        self.transformer_encoder = torch.nn.TransformerEncoder(
            encoder_layers, num_layers=num_layers)
        self.encoder = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)
        self.decoder = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, src):
        src = self.encoder(src) * math.sqrt(self.embed_dim)
        src = self.pos_encoder(src)
        output = self.transformer_encoder(src)
        output = self.decoder(output)
        return output

# Define model parameters
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
vocab_size = 10000 # size of the vocabulary
embed_dim = 256 # dimension of embeddings
num_heads = 4 # number of attention heads
num_layers = 2 # number of layers

# Instantiate model and load weights
model = TransformerModel(vocab_size, embed_dim, num_heads, num_layers).to(device)
checkpoint = torch.load("model_weights.pt", map_location=device)
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint["model_state_dict"])
model.eval()

# Define the sequence to predict on
sequence = "The quick brown"

# Convert sequence to input tensor
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[word2idx[w] for w in sequence.lower().split()]],
                                device=device)

# Predict next word(s) in the sequence
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(input_tensor)
    output = F.softmax(output[0, -1], dim=0)
    # Get top 5 predicted words
    sorted_prob, sorted_indices = torch.sort(output, descending=True)
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"{idx2word[sorted_indices[i].item()]}: {sorted_prob[i].item()}")
```

Here, the `TransformerModel` class is defined, which creates a transformer-based model with the specified architecture. The `forward` method then takes in an input tensor `src` and passes it through the model, ultimately producing an output tensor.

Once the model is instantiated and its weights are loaded, the input sequence is encoded into a tensor using the appropriate vocabulary mappings. The `output` tensor generated by passing the sequence through the model is then converted to a probability distribution using softmax, and this distribution is sorted to obtain the top predicted words.

In this way, Holmes was able to use PyTorch and a transformer-based model to accurately predict the next words in the cryptic notes and solve the case once and for all.
